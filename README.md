**NOTE** As of 12/11/22 this API URL is no longer functioning due to the removal of Heroku's free tier. My app's code is functional but obviously no data will be displayed due to the API call failing. See the API dev's comments at the following link for more details: https://github.com/DB-db-dron/weatherDB/issues/12 

This single page weather application pulls current weather conditions as well as 7 day forecast data from the weatherDB API.
